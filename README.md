# Damage Ranges

> a system for weapon damage range calculation written in rust

so i was bored and decided to make a damage range system that incorperates beziers and i decided that i would not settle for or allow floating point imprecision so i made a custom faction object the only stores 2 u32 a denominator and numerator

oh yeah this is nowhere near done any help would be loved
